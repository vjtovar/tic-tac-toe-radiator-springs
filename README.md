# ‚ùå ‚≠ïÔ∏è Tic Tac Toe

This is a web game for two players on one device, taking turns. You will have to use component state to keep track of whose turn it is and which squares have been marked by each player.

This project will challenge your knowledge of React but should also be an exercise in creating good user experiences. Your view should be styled to look good as well as function flawlessly.

### üìö User Stories
- As a user, I can see a 3x3 grid game board on the page.
    - Branch: game-board
    - Created a container div inside App.js
    - mapped over the board squares to display 9 squares 
    - Applied css to center the game and wrapped the squares in 3x3 grid.

- As a user, I can click on a square to mark it.
    - Branch: mark-square
    - created clickHandler in App.js
    - create clickHandler in Square.js
    - Changed internal state to set to X when clicked
